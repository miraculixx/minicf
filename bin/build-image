#!/bin/bash 
# build the buildpack files and create an image
#
# Use: build-image image buildpack [buildpack [...]]
#
# The image will be built and committed to docker with
# at repository $BUILDPACK with tag latest
#
# 1. Build the context for docker build in $TMP/$BUILDPACK   
#
# ./Dockerfile
# ./bin
# ./bin/build        
# ./bin/compile
# ./bin/detect
# ./bin/release
# ./minicf
# + any files from the buildpack itself
#
# 3. run docker build with $TMP/$BUILDPACK as the context
#    to build and commit the image $BUILDPACK
# 
#    This will run detect/compile/release from $BUILDPACK/bin
#    If there is a $BUILDPACK/Dockerfile it will be used to
#    build the image. Otherwise config/Dockerfile is used. Using
#    this you can specify a default base image specific to the buildpack,
#    or rely on the basic image prepared by minicf
#
# 4. clean up
#
# If all steps run successfully

# set directories

# its own Dockerfile
